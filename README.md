# Prisoners Dilemma

## Description
Prisoners Dilemma is a simulation game where you assume the role of a prison guard tasked with managing a unique prison environment. The prison structure is modeled as a binary tree, with each node representing a cell and each prisoner assigned a unique number. Your objective is to predict and control the movements of the prisoners within the tree.

As a prison guard, you face various challenges such as ensuring the safety and security of the prisoners, maintaining order within the prison, and preventing any potential escape attempts. You must strategically assign prisoners to different branches of the tree to balance the population and prevent overcrowding in specific areas.

Utilizing Unity and Blender, the game provides a visually immersive experience, allowing you to interact with the prison environment and make decisions that directly impact the outcome of the game. Can you effectively manage the prisoners and maintain control of the prison?
